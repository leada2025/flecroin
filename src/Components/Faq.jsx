    },
    {
      question: "Can you drink milk with Flecroin 50 Tablet?",
      answer: "Interference with the absorption of Flecroin 50 Tablet has been observed when taken with dairy products (milk, infant formula, and possibly yogurt). This decreases the level of medicine in the blood and as a result desired effect is not seen. However, it was observed that Flecroin 50 Tablet side effects were more in children who reduced their milk intake. Hence, the dose of Flecroin 50 Tablet needs to be modified accordingly if there is a change in the quantity of milk intake."

    },
    {
      question: "What should I do if I miss a dose?",

    },
